## Features
 * Supports multiple users and multiple nodes per user
 * Supports controling of task authorization.
 * Stores all the node information a Wireless MAN will need: location, height, area, region, backbone & AP interfaces, roof view photos, subnets & hosts in a node etc.
 * Provides an easy (but powerful) way of searching for specific nodes
 * Using [NASA's SRTM data](http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/), it graphs the _Line of Sight_, and _Fresnel Zone_ between two nodes and calculates _Free Space Loss_ for the distance between them
 * Uses [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/) to show the nodes and their links on map.
 * Can be used to manage the distribution of IP Ranges and forward/reverse DNS assigned to each node (_Hostmaster_)
 * Fully themeable interface (using simple (X)HTML templates)
 * Support for localication; Unicode/UTF-8 support
 * Supports provisioning of IPv4 and IPv6 address ranges. 
 * Supports user logging per node for tracking.
 * Integrates with BIND Nameserver for serving the IPv4 DNS zones.
